This is an addon for [The Battle for Wesnoth](https://wesnoth.org).

It was unmaintained and my brother ran into a bug in it, so I fixed the bug.
I posted on the [Wesnoth forums](https://forums.wesnoth.org) [asking](https://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=48495) what I could do to get my patched version on the server, and it was suggested I port it to tBfW 1.14.
So here we are. 
There's a section here for issues, so if anyone cares to they can submit bugs and I'll do my best to fix them. Pull requests for with proposed bug fixes are also welcome. If anyone would like to take over this thing, (like the original author, DrakeDragon on the forums) they can let me know via email or by submitting an issue here on GitHub.
